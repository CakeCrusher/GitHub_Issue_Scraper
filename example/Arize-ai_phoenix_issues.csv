Local (self-hosted)

### What version of Phoenix are you using?

8.31.0

### What operating system are you seeing the problem on?

macOS

### What version of Python are you running Phoenix with?

### What version of Python or Node are you using instrumentation with?

Python 3.13

### What instrumentation are you using?

_No response_

### What happened?

Running a task that takes more than 30 seconds, currently I'm hitting timeout easily. Meaning that tasks are requeued every time this timeout occurs. Looks like you can set the timeout in executors but 'run_experiment' doesn't take this as a parameter. 

### What did you expect to happen?

be able to set timeout when running experiments for longer time durations. 

### How can we reproduce the bug?

1. create a task which waits more than 30 seconds. 
2. run_experiment from phoenix evals.

Alternative is retrieving the prompt plain text, and config variables, then converting those to langchain format manually

It is difficult to find a project from the UI when large amounts of projects are created. Multi-tenant use cases, or use cases where projects are generated via deployment can produce many projects of traces.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Filtering and pagination capabilities on the /projects route.

It would be helpful to find projects by name, or sort them by creation date or last updated date.

### Describe any alternative solutions you've considered

Accessing projects via the API is possible, but is cumbersome if you want to then analyze them in the UI.

### What happened?

A span with 0 token count appeared in the spans table even though the filter was set to `cumulative_token_count.total > 0`

### What did you expect to happen?

The table accurately portrays the filter

### How can we reproduce the bug?

Unsure. Hypothesis is to produce a trace with unknown status, unknown kind, and some child span with or without tokens
