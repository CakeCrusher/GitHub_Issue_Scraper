Meaning that tasks are requeued every time this timeout occurs. Looks like you can set the timeout in executors but 'run_experiment' doesn't take this as a parameter. \n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nbe able to set timeout when running experiments for longer time durations. \n\n### How can we reproduce the bug?\n\n1. create a task which waits more than 30 seconds. \n2. run_experiment from phoenix evals. \n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

                "body": "Thanks @jordan-carson. To send traces, check out the OpenTelemetry SDK for Golang (docs [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/)). You can ask Claude to give you a minimal working example of sending traces with a simple span processor to your Phoenix endpoint via an HTTP exporter, for example. This will give you traces in Phoenix. In order to get opinionated UI, you'll need to set OpenTelemetry attributes in accordance with our [OpenInference semantic conventions](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/blob/main/spec/semantic_conventions.md).\n\nIn terms of submitting evaluations, `/v1/evaluations` expects data submitted via `pyarrow` or proto. We'll be releasing some more traditional REST routes using `application/json` in the next week or two, so check back with the newest versions of Phoenix soon.",
